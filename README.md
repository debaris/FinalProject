# FinalProject


Idea 1


I'm thinking of visualizing some of the instructions from Grapefruit book. It could be a series of connected pages, almost like a story. I could perhaps take one or two things from each chapter and visualize them. Maybe I’ll randomly choose a few and then do the first project I come across as a challenge. It's something I find quite fun, and I've actually started working on one of them, which I could show next week. I include below. Not sure about the Arduino requirement for this one. But definately one of my favorites.

Idea 2


Since we’ve talked talking about games, I thought of a simple news quiz game. It could have a scoring system at the end. It's a practical idea, but not sure how creative it is. Clearly not as it is. Maybe I can make it more interesting— like adding motion or making it harder to select the wrong one. Or, if you click on the wrong answer, it could slowly fade away or disappear - I don’t know how to do that though. But this can be adapted to Arduino. Also, this idea connects with the next project I'm thinking about.

Idea 3


This is related to the previous one. I was thinking of creating a fake news detection game. I'm not sure how creative this will be, but again, I could guide the user to find the truth using sound or motion to give clues. It could be a way to make it more interactive perhaps.

Idea 4

This was an idea suggested by ChatGPT. It’s based on creating something that changes according to the time of day or a user’s mood. I don't think it is a great idea but I can maybe find a way to get some inspiration. I liked working with time. But instead of following the exact suggestion, I thought I could create maybe something like where the music changes based on the user’s mood. I don't know, for example, if someone is angry, I could play calming music for an hour maybe. I could also try moving a visual element in sync with that sound. The issue is, I'm not sure how well I can visualize sound yet, but I might give it a try. This could work well with Arduino.
